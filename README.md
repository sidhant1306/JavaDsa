# My Journey Through Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome! This repository is my digital notebook and a chronicle of my journey learning and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It's where I deconstruct complex problems and build my solutions from the ground up.

My focus is not just on finding a solution, but on understanding the trade-offs and appreciating the elegance of different approaches. I have a particular interest in advanced algorithms like **backtracking and permutations** [1], as they represent a fascinating intersection of creativity and logic.

## What's Inside?

Here you will find my solutions to problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other educational resources, organized by topic:

*   **Fundamental Structures:** Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
*   **Non-Linear Structures:** Trees, Tries, Graphs, Heaps
*   **Algorithmic Techniques:**
    *   Two Pointers & Sliding Window
    *   Recursion & Backtracking
    *   Dynamic Programming
    *   Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)

## My Goal

The purpose of this repository is twofold: to solidify my own understanding by practicing regularly, and to create a portfolio of clean, high-quality code that demonstrates my problem-solving abilities.

Thanks for visiting, and happy coding!
